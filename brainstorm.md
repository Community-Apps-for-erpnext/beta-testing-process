# Questions

- should testers focus on one part of the system or just play around with everything (so there will be testers who only look into accounting, while others only look into 'Selling', etc)?
- should the beta test be monitored by anyone or just run as it goes?
- would it make sense to creat a standard form for the default tests where just succes/fail will be recorded?
