# Questions

- should testers focus on one part of the system or just play around with everything (so there will be testers who only look into accounting, while others only look into 'Selling', etc)?
- should the beta test be monitored by anyone or just run as it goes?
- would it make sense to creat a standard form for the default tests where just succes/fail will be recorded?
- is it possible that mycompany.erpnext.com cloud-uers who participate in the beta get a copy of their instances for testing purposes (mycompany-beta.erpnext.com). If this is desired, need to add a procedure to apply for the beta program
